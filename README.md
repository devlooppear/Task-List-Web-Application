# Task-List-Web-Application
This is a simple web application that allows you to manage your tasks. You can add new tasks, mark them as complete, and remove tasks from the list. The application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it leverages the localStorage feature to persist tasks even after page reloads.
